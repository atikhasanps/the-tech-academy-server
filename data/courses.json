            "description":"This course starts from the beginning, covering the basics of how a computer interprets lines of code; how to write programs, evaluate their output, and revise the code itself; how to work with variables and their changing values; and how to use mathematical, boolean, and relational operators.By the end of this course, you'll be able to write small programs in Python that use variables, mathematical operators, and logical operators. For example, you could write programs that carry out complex mathematical operations, like calculating the interest rate necessary to reach a savings goal, recommending apparel options based on weather patterns, or calculating a grade based on multiple percentages.Structurally, the course is comprised of several parts. Instruction is delivered via a series of short (2-3 minute) videos. In between those videos, you'll complete both multiple choice questions and coding problems to demonstrate your knowledge of the material that was just covered."

            "description":"Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview? Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?  C++ .Why you should learn C++? Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years. Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you? If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers. But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful!What do I mean by powerful?C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible."
